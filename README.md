# Store_SQL_Analysis

This case study focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL queries. The objective is to gain insights and perform various analyses on the dataset. The study is divided into several parts.

# Background
Customers has purchasing transaction that we shall be monitoring to get intuition behind each 
customer behavior to target the customers in the most efficient and proactive way, to increase 
sales/revenue , improve customer retention and decrease churn.


## Part 1: Exploration

In this phase, the data is explored using a drill-down approach. The main focus is on sales data, and the analysis starts with an overall view of the sum of sales. The exploration then progresses to more granular levels, including monthly sales, top-selling products by quantity and revenue, and top customers by revenue and quantity.

## Part 2: Customer Segmentation

In this part, customer segmentation is performed based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. The analysis considers the most recent purchase date, the number of purchases, and the total amount spent by each customer. Customers are segmented into different groups based on their scores in these categories, resulting in distinct customer segments.

## Part 3: Correlation Analysis

Additional analysis is performed to investigate the correlation between various factors. The correlation between the number of customer visits and the average money spent is examined to determine if increased visits lead to higher spending. Another correlation analysis focuses on the relationship between quantity and revenue to assess the strength of the correlation.

## Part 4: Store Data Analysis

In this part, a different dataset related to store transactions is analyzed. The analysis addresses two questions: the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases and the average number of days/transactions required for a customer to reach a spending threshold of 250 L.E. The analysis utilizes techniques such as lag functions and cumulative sums to calculate the desired metrics.

The case study provides valuable insights into sales data and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making for improving business strategies and maximizing revenue.

Please note that this summary provides an overview of the case study without including the specific SQL queries.
